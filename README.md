I have completed all the tasks except the last one(about method updates).
I don't know how to create it correctly.
I can found the average value of ‘Worldwide Gross’ for ‘Comedy’ movies, minimum ‘Audience score %’ for ‘Drama’ movies
, create insert method, insert one movie to the table and also count the number of it before and after insert.
